# AOSP zero-common (Samsung Galaxy S6)
Common device repository for zero (Samsung Galaxy S6)

-> Work In Progress. <-

-> Force-pushing is likely to happen! <-

### Disclaimer
*I am not responsible for your actions.*

If you decide to compile this and flash this to your device and something breaks,
I do not care. Your fault. And if you write me an email complaining about me breaking your stuff,
I will laugh at you.
